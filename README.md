# VirtualHostCreator
Python 3 script to create apache virtual hosts on debian 10

Disclaimer: I do not take any responsibility for this code. I'm not a server admin, and all I did is a try to automate creating virtual hosts, setting up directories and let's encrypt cert. I made this script public hoping to get some advices / improvements from people like you!
